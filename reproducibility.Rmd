This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r,echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
set.seed(seed=4)
```

```{r,echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# these are the libraries we will use:
library(RCurl)
library(ggplot2)
library(vegan)
library(devtools)
# run these:
URL<-("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ryanjw/ngs-3rdweek/master/visualizations/datasets/fly_data.txt")
dataset<-read.table(textConnection(getURL(URL)),header=T,check.names=F,sep="\t")
head(dataset[,1:10])
```

Let's look at one transcript "FBgn0000022", color by fly 
```{r,echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# don't run tests, because it is computationally intense and might crash 
# let's look at it first
# just insert one of the transcripts,
# color by fly type "fly"
# set alpha to 0.
ggplot(dataset)+geom_density(aes(x=FBgn0000022,fill=fly,alpha=0.5))
```

Then, histogram of same transcript "FBgn0000022", color by fly
```{r,echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(dataset)+geom_histogram(aes(x=FBgn0000022,fill=fly,alpha=0.5))
# discrete bins of 
names(dataset)[1:50]
ggplot(dataset)+geom_histogram(aes(x=FBgn0000056,fill=fly,alpha=0.5),binwidth=100)
```
Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
